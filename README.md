# GIS_ABM_Benchmark_Study

## Introduction

This repository contains the materials and scripts for the Bachelor thesis project titled "Comparative Benchmarking of Agent-Based Modeling Platforms in Spatial Simulations: An Analysis of Agents.jl vs. GAMA" at the University of Salzburg, for the Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Digitalization-Innovation-Society.

## Repository Structure

- **data/**: Contains datasets used in the simulations and results.
  - **raw_data/**: Raw datasets before processing.
  - **processed_data/**: Processed datasets ready for analysis.
  - **results/**: Results from the benchmark simulations.
  
- **scripts/**: Contains scripts for running simulations, processing data, and creating visualizations.
  - **agents_jl/**: Scripts specific to Agents.jl.
  - **gama/**: Scripts specific to GAMA.
  - **common/**: Common scripts used across both platforms, such as Docker setup and utility functions.
  
- **analysis/**: Contains R scripts for Monte Carlo simulations, linear regression analysis, and exploratory data analysis.
  - **plots/**: Generated plots for visualization of results.
  
- **docs/**: Contains documentation, thesis drafts, references, and figures.
  - **figures/**: Figures used in the thesis document.
  
- **docker/**: Docker configuration files for setting up a consistent testing environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Ensure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed on your system.
- **Julia**: Install Julia from [official site](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
- **GAMA**: Install GAMA platform from [official site](https://gama-platform.org/).
- **R**: Install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

## Analysis

Detailed analysis scripts are available in the analysis/ directory. This includes Monte Carlo simulations and linear regression analyses used to evaluate the performance metrics.

## Contributing

Currently, contributions are limited as this is a Bachelor thesis project. Feedback is welcome and can be submitted via issues. Contributions will be considered after the thesis has been graded.

## License
